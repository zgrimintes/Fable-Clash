# Fable-Clash
I'm making a game for Tales of Us(ToU) witch is an non governmental organization.
They created an project called World of Us, in witch children can learn about the world around them while playing games.
In colaboration with The Game Dev Academy they proposed us a GameLab in witch we have to make a game for children(8-14 years old) inspired by romanian mytology.
My game is an street fighter kind of game in witch nine characters from traditional tales fight with eachother in teams of three.

The game is made with Unity version 2021.3.13f1 .
